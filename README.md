## Why Kerberos.io?

As burgalary is very common, we believe that video surveillance is a **trivial tool** in our daily lifes which helps us to **feel** a little bit more **secure**. Responding to this need, a lot of companies have started developing their own video surveillance software in the past few years.

Nowadays we have a myriad of **expensive** cameras, recorders and software solutions which are mainly **outdated** and **difficult** to install and use. Kerberos.io's goal is to solve these problems and to provide every human being in this world to have its own **ecological**, **affordable**, **easy-to-use** and **innovative** surveillance solution.

## Introduction

[Kerberos.io](https://kerberos.io) is a **low-budget** video surveillance solution, that uses computer vision algorithms to detect changes, and that can trigger other devices. [Kerberos.io](https://kerberos.io) is open source so everyone can customize the source code to its needs and share it with the community. When deployed on the Raspberry Pi, it has a **green footprint** and it's **easy to install**; you only need to transfer the [Kerberos.io OS (KIOS)](https://doc.kerberos.io/2.0/installation/KiOS) to your SD card and that's it.

Use your mobile phone, tablet or PC to keep an eye on your property. View the images taken by [Kerberos.io](https://kerberos.io) with our responsive and user-friendly web interface. Look at the dashboard to get a graphical overview of the past days. Multiple [Kerberos.io](https://kerberos.io) instances can be installed and can be viewed with only 1 web interface.

# Docker

**--- For the moment this approach only works for IP cameras, we don't have a cross-platform method to inject a USB camera or Raspberry Pi camera ---**

A Docker image (x86) is available on [**the Docker Hub**](https://hub.docker.com/u/kerberos/kerberos). Before you can run this image you will have to get [**Docker**](https://docker.com) installed. After the installation you can use **docker run** to get Kerberos.io up and running.

## Run a simple command.

After you've installed docker, you can open a command prompt and type in following command. This will pull the kerberos image and make the web interface available on port 80 and the livestream on port 8889. You can give the container a custom name using the **--name** property.

    $ docker run --name camera1 -p 80:80 -p 8889:8889 -d kerberos/kerberos
    $ docker run --name camera2 -p 81:80 -p 8890:8889 -d kerberos/kerberos
    $ docker run --name camera3 -p 82:80 -p 8891:8889 -d kerberos/kerberos
